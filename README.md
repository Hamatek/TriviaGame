Made in 5h

when I tried to eject it didn't work, so I spent more time than expected on setup.

Since design didn't seems to be one of the important key areas, I kept things to a minimum. I did make a small pinterest board in case I have to work on design . https://www.pinterest.co.kr/stykeurs/quizz-ui/

In terms of feature if I had more free time I would add a timer, and the possibility for the player to choose a theme and a difficulty.
The game could make use of redux-persist to track player progress even if the app is closed.

also I would use i18n for all the static string, but since trivia doesn't seems to support other language I didn't see the point to use it yet.

If what you see is not enough but you are interest to work with me, please let me know... I can spend a bit more time to improve the project add features, style and test.

Note:
I tried to use Ramda even if I didn't really because I just read their doc and saw how useful it could be.
